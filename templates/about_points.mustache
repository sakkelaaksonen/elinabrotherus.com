<h3 class="sBTitle">Points of View on Landscape (2006)</h3>

<p class="ingress">
I started the Points of View on Landscape diptychs earlier this year as a continuation for my five images entitled Der Wanderer. The first part of the diptych shows a figure seen from the back contemplating a landscape. In the second part, we see the same figure but this time in frontal view. In fact, the figure is standing still and it is the camera that is being displaced; first behind her, then in front of her. The figure is that of the artist. The author and the model are one and the same. The observer is also being observed.

The camera equals the spectator of the final photograph: he sees exactly what the camera has seen at the moment of exposure. In the first part of the diptych he watches the same landscape as the figure. There is the shared gaze: the artist/model invites the spectator to watch with her what she has chosen to look at. The spectator doesn't see the eyes but he sees what they are aimed at.

In the second part the spectator steps in front of the view, substituting for it. The artist's gaze now falls on him. Another landscape opens to him: the one where the wanderer is coming from.
