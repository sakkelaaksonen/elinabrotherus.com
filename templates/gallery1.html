<h3 class="sBTitle">The New Painting</h3><p>«Photography is the new painting», said my friend Edda Jonsdottir, director of i8 gallery in Reykjavik. With this somewhat provocative sentence in mind in June 2000 I started my still ongoing series, “The New Painting.” I use contemporary means of expression  (large format   color photography), but I owe a lot to the aesthetics of classical figurative painting. With the camera I try to approach the same problems that painters have been dealing with for centuries: light, color, composition, figures in space, projection of the three-dimensional into the two-dimensional. I find these questions fundamental in all visual arts.</p>
<p>The subject matters come from my close surroundings - from where I live, where I travel, with whom I share my time. Formally the images fall into two categories: landscapes, notably the Horizon works (called Horizons, Low Horizons, and Very Low Horizons, depending on the division of the picture plane), and works with the human figure.</p>
<p>Like in my earlier work, I frequently use myself as a model. However, these new works escape from the inherent problem of self-portraiture, the problem of «representing oneself». They do not aim at drawing a psychological portrait of the subject, but rather presenting him/her as an object of investigation, not for the inner properties but for the external ones. The human figure offers endless possibilities. How do the figures interact with space and with each other? How does the light reveal the form? What happens if the direction of the gaze changes? The human body in its beauty and its banality never stops to fascinate me.</p>
<p>The Finnish writer Tove Jansson once said that she loves borderlines: the horizon, which is the border between sea and sky, or dusk, the border between day and night. It is like the tension between two people who are falling in love, but haven’t yet confessed it to one another. To me it is important to combine the horizon works with the portraits. Contemplating the horizon - the rim of the world - puts the mind at rest and fills the lungs with cool air. These works search for beauty and are motivated by it, even if «beauty», whatever we mean by it, might be considered controversial in contemporary art.</p>
