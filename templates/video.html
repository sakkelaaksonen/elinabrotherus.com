   A silent study with the camera placed at a consistent vantage point, of the weather, color of water and sky, and of a lone figure who enters the water, returns and walks out of the frame. Filmed over a period of one summer, at different times of the day and night.

 <p>(---) The Black Bay Sequence evolves from an earlier series of works called Baigneurs (I, II and III, 2001/2003). In these Brotherus showed unclothed swimmers in the Northern Arctic lakes and the sea. In this new piece we also see a swimmer go into the water, a woman. The title is a translation of the name of the Finnish lake where the work is filmed</p>

 <p>
  The film is shown on a loop, although it is not imperative to watch it from beginning to end, as there is no unfolding narrative. Instead it is a study, with the camera placed at a consistent vantage point, of the water and sky, with the horizon as constant back drop. Due to the consistent framing of the image we notice how the weather impacts on the scene. At times the water is tranquil, a flat and reflective surface like a mirror, whilst at other points it is turbulent and becomes unwelcoming and wild. 

 </p>

 <p>
   other points it is turbulent and becomes unwelcoming and wild.
Brotherus has made the work over a period of time, at different times of the day and night. She has stated: “I often work in the early morning, in the evening or at night when the scarcity of light means long exposure times are necessary. In a sense this means that my photographs are about capturing a period of time, rather than being about the decisive instant.” In some ways this film also operates like this, more like a series of expanded still photographs, rather than a moving image work.
 </p>

 <p>
   (---) The human figure that appears perhaps has a secondary role to the piece, yet it is key to it. It is as though she is there so that we can gauge the scale of the scene before us. It is due to this placing of a person in nature, as well as her interest in the sublime beauty of landscape, that has led her work to be compared to Caspar David Friedrich’s paintings. He too would strategically place a figure looking out to the scene before them – as a way of commenting on the futility of man’s attempts to shape and control the wilderness. In Friedrich’s work the person would always seem tiny and insignificant, dwarfed and engulfed by the land around them. However in Brotherus’ work there seems more of an equal, symbiotic relationship between woman and nature. It speaks of a fearlessness, and a determination to not only coexist with our natural surroundings but to thrive in it. (---)This work is about the passage of time as well as the beauty of nature a

<div class="synopsis">
 <p>
  Bright, Bright Day is a simple composition with the camera remaining in one place throughout. The scene is of a grassy hill slope in an olive grove, shot in the golden light of the late afternoon. In the middle distance stands a female figure in a grey dress. She slowly starts to walk towards the camera, and in the end is standing close to it, at which point we clearly see it is Brotherus. The work has a sound track – which at first is ambient noises of birds and a distant dog bark – but which blends into a piece of accordion music by the Finnish composer Maria Kalaniemi. A poem appears in subtitles, by Arseniy Tarkovsky, the father of the film-maker Andrej, written in 1942. It is a poem eulogising about a remembered memory of idyllic harmony with nature. Yet, as so often with Brotherus’ work, it is tinged with melancholy. It speaks of loss more generally, such as the grief when loved ones pass away, and how over time memories of them can start to fade. They, as this remembered moment of idyllic happiness, are in the past – never to be recaptured. (From Camilla Brown: Elina Brotherus, Comma 27, Bloomberg SPACE, London 2010.)

  <div class="synopsis">
    
    <p>
Who is watching whom? Who is the artist, who is the model? Who gets the “last gaze”?
Having used myself as a model since a long time, I wanted to develop further the notions of the artist’s gaze, the model and the self-portrait of an artist. Last summer I met two young painters, Jan Neva and Teemu Korpela. They have studied at the Academy of Fine Arts of St. Petersburg, where the academic tradition of painting the nude still prevails.
    </p>

    <p>
      In art history one can find a type of image where the painter presents himself with the model in the studio (and often looks over his shoulder towards the spectator). I wanted a situation where it is the model who presents herself posing as a model. Traditionally the painter watches the model and the model watches nobody. In our “unholy model session” the roles get mixed: the model becomes an image-maker and the painters become models. In principle the situation is similar to that where I’m making a solitary self-portrait, facing the camera on a tripod, and showing with the cable release that I’m at the same time author and subject, artist and model. However, the painters at work concretisize the posing as even more real. Furthermore, I was curious to hear how it would affect the painters’ work when the model looks back at them, observs the observers, makes in turn their portrait with her own medium.
    </p>
    <p>
    I was posing for Jan and Teemu in the Kalervo Kallio Ateljee in Helsinki, November-December 2009. They were painting me and I was filming us at the same time. I realised a series of nine photographs (medium format analog c-prints) and a HD digital video with two cameras.

  <p>
    Hanna Brotherus is a dancer and a choreographer, who has three sons. "Brotherus, tyttö" was shot after the birth of her fourth child. The title refers to the fact that for the first time "Brotherus, Boy" was not written at the foot of the cot at the clinic. (N.B. the Finnish word "tyttö" stands for "girl". It is the habit at Finnish maternity clinics to write on the bed the surname of the family and the sex of the baby at the foot of the cot.) The dancer advances of a road, and when the rehearsed choreography ends, she steps into the forest, into the unknown. There she encounters the new child. It is the mother's way towards her daughter, a daughter who came into life through all obstacles.

  <div class="synopsis">
    <p>
      The Baigneurs video installation portrays nude swimmers in Finnish nature. The form is cyclic, repetitive: a swimmer plunges into water and returns, waves hit the shore; only the places and figures change. The bodies are simultaneously beautiful and banal. 
      </p>
      <p>
Baigneurs examines beauty through the (National) Romanticist landscape and the classical bather motif. The water plays as important a role as the figures: its colour, the reflection or rippling of the surface.
Baigneurs is a "sister work" to my photographs of the same theme. It is interesting to compare them to each other. The still photographs easily fall within the the bather tradition in painting (nude by the waterfront), whereas the movement in the video brings in uncanny realism which is absent in photography or painting.

      <i>  Attends-moi je t'aime  </i>  (Wait for me I love you) is a small love declaration. It makes reference to Claude Nougaro's song from 1962, where a man is running after a girl through Paris and finally reaches her at the Place de la Concorde.

  <div class="synopsis">
    <p>Miroir is an investigation of a process that takes place in time. Vapor on a mirror disappears and reveals the mirror image, the portrait. The video Miroir is a moving image counterpart to my photographic work Le Miroir, a series of 5 photographs. It can also be seen as an allegory of Photography, which in its origins (daguerrotype) was a mirror (a copper plate coated with silver) where an image gradually appeared during the developing.</p>

  <div class="synopsis">
    <p>
      Spring is about the culmination of all longing and desire: waiting for the reappearance of light after the dark winter. Each part of the triptych presents a horizon, which makes reference to my photographic work about horizons, but here the horizon is moving. The landscape flows by the spectator in a continuous, calm, never-ending movement. All three projections are looped, and as they differ in length, the work produces new combinations all the time. The 5.1 sound coming from all directions is composed with different wind and rain sounds, with a short notion of blackbird and skylark.
